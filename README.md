## Project Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
- To design and implement a relational database that captures the essential data for analyzing graduate program performance.
- To create and optimize SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and support informed decision-making.
- To streamline the process of tracking program performance and faculty contributions to improve academic strategies.

## Key Features
- **Relational Database Design**: Includes tables for graduate programs, faculty, ranking sources, criteria, and related data.
- **Data Integrity**: Implemented referential constraints to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Created views and queries to analyze latest program rankings, track performance trends, and evaluate faculty impact.

## Database Schema
The database comprises the following key tables:
- **GraduateProgram**: Stores information about graduate programs.
- **Faculty**: Captures details about faculty members and their teaching assignments.
- **RankSource**: Contains information on ranking sources and criteria.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For database creation, data management, and querying.
- **SQL Server Management Studio**: Used for designing and managing the database.
- **Power BI**: Integrated for data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Usage and Query Examples
Examples of SQL queries included in this repository:
- **Latest_Rank_View**: Provides the most recent ranking data for all graduate programs.
- **Top_Rank_Faculty_View**: Identifies faculty members teaching in top-ranked programs.
- **Criteria_Evaluation_Query**: Analyzes specific ranking criteria across different programs.

## Conclusions
This project demonstrates the ability to build and manage a relational database that serves as a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing graduate program performance. By providing structured data storage and insightful querying capabilities, the database supports the schoolâ€™s strategic goals for continuous improvement and academic excellence.
